# Tachometer Dial Reference

This reference refers to the dimensions of the tachometer dial face which determines many of the PCB size and placement requirements and the mechanical design of the dash project.

The Tachometer face used is from a Honda CBR 600F as the max RPM value is similar to the CBR 125RW6 I have and I like how the dial is even on both sides of the center line instead of it being offset values. I also like it as the speedometer dial face is the same dimensions as the tachometer one allowing me to switch from a tachometer dial to a speedometer dial if I wanted to.

I purchased this dial gauge face from [newtacho.de](https://www.newtacho.de/shop/honda-en/speedometer-dials-gauge-honda-cbf-600/?lang=en) which is a German based company that sells around Europe but other sellers will likely offer the same thing.

The reference dimensions are found by taking a top down image of the dial face with a ruler next to it for scale. This is then imported into [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/), scaled and draw over to get a CAD model of the dial face. Once a CAD model is made it is used to make an engineering drawing which is used as reference for a reference footprint in the Full circuit schematic. This CAD model is also used in the mechancial design as a reference for case dimensions.
