# Display initial test for CBR dash project

This testing script is a copy from new haven displays script found [here](https://support.newhavendisplay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415264814231-NHD-C12832A1Z-with-Arduino). I made some slight modifications to work with my setup.

The circuit is the V1 version of the PCB. You could directly wire it instead of using the PCB but for testing to make sure the PCB was correct i used this.
