# CBR_Custom_Cluster

A custom cluster design for my CBR 125RW6 (2006 carb model) to replace the old large mechanical cluster with a smaller simpler design.



The `references` folder contains details on set things on the bike (eg. hole position dimensions, resistance of stock sensor) and thus design requirements, calculations and decisions can be found here.
